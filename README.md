# questionnaire
- A small and simple questions application built with Django and bootstrap 4 using crispy-forms.
- A live version of this app can be found here (https://benefique-bastille-98761.herokuapp.com/)
- Go to (https://benefique-bastille-98761.herokuapp.com/admin) and use admin adminadmin to play around with the models I built.
- You will see a user has been added and have passed one question already and there is only 1 question (feel free to add more). Answer checking is a very basic/naive
string comparison. Nevertheless this is an idea that can be built on for more complex questions. e.g checking executed code output against expected outputs or adding
multiple choice questions as they do in remote learning sites like Unisa and Pluralsight.
